LCBO API launched in the summer of 2009 to act as a data source for mobile
phone apps, at that time there was no official iPhone application. Today
LCBO API is being utilized more than ever, as of September 2014 LCBO API
serves between 60,000 to 80,000 requests per day, a number that continues to
grow.

The primary goal of LCBO API is to provide developers, hobbyists, and anyone
who is interested with a way to take advantage of the unique benefits and
data that come from having a single provider of alcoholic beverages in a
large geographical area.

The API is primarily designed to provide JSON data directly to mobile and
web applications, but it is also capable of returning CSV data to be used
directly in a spreadsheet application, just add `.csv` to the end of any
LCBO API endpoint.
