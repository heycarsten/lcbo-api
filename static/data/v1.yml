    ## Responses & Formats

    The default response format for the API V1 is JSON `application/json`.
    This means that you don't need to specify JSON in an `Accept` header or as
    an extension (`.json`) if that is the format you intend to request.

    ### JSON

    All responses are wrapped in a container object, in its most basic form
    it looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "status": 200,
      "message": null,
      "result": ...
    }
    ```

    This allows the API to return meta information along with the data you are
    requesting. For example, in the case of the
    [Stores with Product](/docs/v1/stores-with-product) endpoint, the product
    object is returned with the list of stores so that your application does
    not have to perform an additional request to obtain the store information.

    ### CSV

    Many resources can be returned as CSV (comma separated values) or TSV
    (tab separated values). These results can then be easily imported into
    spreadsheet software such as Apple Numbers or Microsoft Excel. To return
    a resource in CSV or TSV format simply append the `.csv` or `.tsv`
    extension to the resource URI:

    <pre><code>/products<em>.csv</em>?order=price_in_cents.desc
    </code></pre>

    ### Pagination

    When the API returns collections of items (stores, products, or inventories)
    it will paginate the results instead of returning all of them at once. You
    can control the number of items per page through the `per_page` parameter.

    A typical pager object looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "records_per_page": 20,
      "total_record_count": 608,
      "current_page_record_count": 20,
      "is_first_page": false,
      "is_final_page": false,
      "current_page": 5,
      "current_page_path": "/stores?page=5",
      "next_page": 6,
      "next_page_path": "/stores?page=6",
      "previous_page": 4,
      "previous_page_path": "/stores?page=4",
      "final_page": 31,
      "final_page_path": "/stores?page=31"
    }
    ```

    It contains all of the information you need (and more) to navigate through
    the pages in the result set.

- anchor: 'authentication'
  title: 'Authentication'
  is_sub: true
  body: |
    ## Authentication

    **LCBO API V1 does not require authentication for access.** Starting on
    <b>March 8<sup>th</sup>, 2015</b>, LCBO API V1 **will** require Access Keys
    for **unlimited** use. New features in LCBO API V1 such as HTTPS and CORS
    **require authentication** with an Access Key.

    <p class="info">
      You can provision an unlimited number of Access Keys for free by
      <a href="/sign-up">creating</a> an LCBO API account.
    </p>

    There are three different types of access keys, they have specific
    use-cases in mind:

    <table class="auth-keys-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th width="22%">Key Type</th>
          <th width="78%">Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td width="22%">
            <b>Web Browser</b>
          </td>
          <td width="78%">
            Use when LCBO API is accessed from a web browser through
            <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (Ajax/XHR)
            using CORS or through dynamically inserted <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
            tags (JSONP). These keys are rate-limited per client IP address and
            are paired to a domain. For example, a Web Browser Access Key
            associated with the domain <b>momsandhops.ca</b> would fail to work
            if used on a page served from <b>thebeerstore.ca</b>.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="22%">
            <b>Native Client</b>
          </td>
          <td width="78%">
            In native mobile and desktop applications, these keys are rate-limited per
            client but do not support CORS or JSONP.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="22%">
            <b>Private</b>
          </td>
          <td width="78%">
            When LCBO API is accessed from a web server or private script, these keys are not rate-limited, and they do not support CORS or JSONP.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    ### Using Access Keys

    <p class="info">
      Detailed usage information is provided in the LCBO API Manager when you
      create access keys.
    </p>

    Your access key will need to be sent with every request you make to LCBO API,
    you can do this the following ways:

    #### HTTP Header

    This is the recommended way of adding your Access Key to requests:

    ```
    Authorization: Token token="myLCBOAPIaccessKey"
    ```

    #### Query Parameter

    Aside from JSONP, you should always try to use the HTTP Header method
    outlined above. Add your access key to the URL like this:

    ```
    http://lcboapi.com/products?access_key=myLCBOAPIaccessKey
    ```

    #### Basic Auth

    If the tool you're using will only support setting the `Authorization`
    header by username/password, you can provide the following values to pass
    along your Access Key to LCBO API.

    ```
    Username: x-access-key
    Password: myLCBOAPIaccessKey
    ```

- anchor: 'errors'
  title: 'Errors'
  is_sub: true
  body: |
    ## Errors

    When an error occurs the response will look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      "error": "bad_query_error",
      "message": "A value supplied for the order parameter (id.desk) is not valid. It contains an invalid sort order (desk) for (id) try using: id.desc or id.asc instead.",
      "result": null,
      "status": 400
    }
    ```

    Error messages are always as descriptive as possible and they fall into one
    of the below categories:

    | Code               | Description                                         |
    | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
    | `no_results_error` | The geocoder returned no geometry for the geo query. |
    | `over_limit_error` | The geocoder has reached its daily limit of requests. |
    | `geocoder_error`   | The geocoder can't geocode the query it was provided. |
    | `not_found_error`  | A resource was not found (404) |
    | `bad_query_error`  | One (or more) of the supplied query parameters is wrong. |
    | `jsonp_error`      | Supplied callback is not a valid format, or JSONP is not being used correctly. |
    | `unauthorized`     | The feature you're trying to use requires an Access Key |

- anchor: 'cross-origin-access'
  title: 'Cross Origin Access'
  body: |
    ## Cross Origin Access

    LCBO API provides support for cross-origin requests so that it can be used
    from a web page. In the past, due to the Single Origin Policy implemented
    in all web browsers, there were only two ways to do this. Either by
    proxying all requests through the origin server, or by using a technique
    called JSONP. Today, all modern browsers implement Cross Origin Resource
    Sharing (CORS). LCBO API supports all of these techniques.

    ### HTTP Proxy

    In a proxy setup, the API consumer implements an endpoint on their web
    server that proxies all requests to and responses from LCBO API. For
    example, the following endpoint on your web server:

    ```
    mysite.com/lcboapi/*
    ```

    Would then proxy anything after lcboapi/ to lcboapi.com, as if it were a
    part of your site, even though those requests are actually being delegated
    to lcboapi.com. So a request to your server like this:

    ```
    mysite.com/lcboapi/products
    ```

    Would actually request this page on LCBO API:

    ```
    lcboapi.com/products
    ```

    And your site would then return the result of that LCBO API response.

    This approach is not bad, the browser doesn't care because all of the
    requests are to the same domain, and given the performance of modern web
    servers like Nginx and Apache the overhead is quite low. The downside is
    that it requires infrastructure and configuration to work properly and
    ultimately becomes another thing to maintain. This leads us to the first
    way to truly request 3<sup>rd</sup> party data from a web page: JSONP.

- anchor: 'jsonp'
  title: 'JSONP'
  is_sub: yes
  body: |
    ### JSONP

    JSONP stands for JSON with Padding and works by dynamically attaching
    `<script>` elements to a web page, that call a previously defined function
    in order to load data.

    To use JSONP with LCBO API, simply add a <code>callback</code> parameter
    to LCBO API URLs. When using JSONP LCBO API also sets the response
    `Content-Type` to `application/javascript` since the response is now
    executable JavaScript, and not just data (JSON) anymore.

    Here's how the whole process works, say you have a globally defined
    function named `loadStore` on your page, like this:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>LCBO Learnin'</title>
        <script>
          function loadStore(response) {
            var el = document.getElementById('store_name');
            el.innerHTML = response.result.name;
          }
        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1 id="store_name"></h1>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    And you dynamically insert a `<script>` tag on the page using a function
    like this:

    ```javascript
    function loadStore(id) {
      var script = document.createElement('script');

      script.src = 'http://lcboapi.com/stores/'+id+'?callback=loadStore';
      script.async = true;

      document.head.appendChild(script);
    }

    loadStore(511);
    ```

    LCBO API retuns a JavaScript file that looks like this:

    ```javascript
    loadStore({
      status: 200,
      message: null,
      result: {
        "id": 511,
        "name": "King & Spadina",
        ...
      }
    });
    ```

    Which effectively calls our prevously defined `loadStore` function with the
    response data as its sole argument, so our `<h1>` tag is filled with the
    name of the store.

    It's important to note that most popular JavaScript libraries have built-in
    support for JSONP. For example, the following jQuery can be used to perform
    a JSONP request against LCBO API:

    ```javascript
    $.ajax({
      url: 'http://lcboapi.com/products/371906',
      dataType: 'jsonp'
    }).then(function(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });
    ```

    _I **highly** recommend using a library like jQuery to manage JSONP
    orchistration._

- anchor: 'cors'
  title: 'CORS'
  is_sub: yes
  body: |
    ### CORS

    Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a robust W3C specification for
    allowing browsers to access resources from different domains. LCBO API uses
    it to give access to web browser JavaScript applications.

    If you need to support outdated bowsers,
    [specifically IE 6 and 7](http://caniuse.com/#feat=cors), you'll either have
    to use a proxy or JSONP. Hilariously, with the advent of async script tags
    `<script async>` JSONP can be about as effective in modern browsers as
    using XMLHttpRequest with CORS. If you have to support older browsers that
    don't understand CORS, there is no shame in using JSONP.

    If you don't have to support IE 6 and 7, _welcome to the future!_ To use CORS
    with LCBO API you need to provide a Web Browser Access Key with your
    requests. You'll need an LCBO API account to create Access Keys,
    [sign up](/sign-up) for one and get started. You can also
    [read more](#authentication) about LCBO API authentication.

    Once you have a Web Browser Access Key, using LCBO API with CORS from jQuery
    is as simple as:

    ```javascript
    $.ajax({
      url: 'http://lcboapi.com/products/346197',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Token YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
      }
    }).then(function(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });
    ```
- anchor: https
  title: HTTPS
  body: |
    ## HTTPS

    LCBO API now supports secured connections over HTTPS, this is particularly
    useful when you want to request data over JSONP or CORS on a webpage that
    was served over HTTPS.

    To use HTTPS you must provide an Access Key. [Sign Up](/sign-up) for an
    LCBO API account to create one.

    <p class="info">
      Agency stores are not included in LCBO API, a
      <a href="http://thirsty.kx.nu/js/agency.js">JSON file</a> of them was
      kindly provided by Svante Richter.
    </p>

    Open and close times are reperesented in minutes since midnight. This
    format can be converted into 24 hour time using the approach below:

    ```javascript
    function msmTo24time(msm) {
      var hour = msm / 60;
      var mins = msm % 60;

      return [hour, mins];
    }
    ```

    You will probably want to convert the minutes since midnight to 12 hour time
    since that's what most Ontarians will be familiar with, you can do that
    with a few extra steps:

    ```javascript
    function msmTo12time(msm) {
      var time = msmTo24time(msm);
      var h24  = time[0];
      var h12  = (0 == h24 ? 12 : (h24 > 12 ? (h24 - 10) - 2 : h24));
      var ampm = (h24 >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM');

      return [h12, time[1], ampm];
    }
    ```
