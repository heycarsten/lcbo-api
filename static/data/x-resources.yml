    Represents a physical LCBO location, please note that agency stores are not
    included in LCBO API. Svante Richter was kind enough to provide a JSON dump
    of LCBO agency stores, it can be found here:
    [http://thirsty.kx.nu/js/agency.js](http://thirsty.kx.nu/js/agency.js)

    Store Open / Close times are reperesented in minutes since midnight and can
    be easily converted into 24 hour time. To get the clock hour, divide the
    minutes since midnight by 60. To get the minute value, mod the number by 60.
    Here is some example JavaScript that demonstrates how to perform the
    calculation:

    ```javascript
    function msmTo24time(msm) {
      var hour = msm / 60;
      var mins = msm % 60;
      return [hour, mins];
    }
    ```

    You will probably want to convert the minutes since midnight to 12 hour time
    since that's what most folks from Ontario will be familiar with, you can do
    that with a few extra steps:

    ```javascript
    function msmTo12time(msm) {
      var time = msmTo24time(msm),
          h24  = time[0],
          h12  = (0 == h24 ? 12 : (h24 > 12 ? (h24 - 10) - 2 : h24)),
          ampm = (h24 >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM');
      return [h12, time[1], ampm];
    }
    ```

    An inventory reflects the quantity of a product at a store, the
    reported quantity is an estimate, quantities for seasonal and discontinued
    products are also often inaccurate due to increased demand. This result
