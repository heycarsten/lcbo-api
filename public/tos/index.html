    <article class="document">
      <h1>1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Welcome to LCBO API! (a.k.a. &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;). We are excited to
have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions
(collectively, these &ldquo;Terms of Service&rdquo;) apply to your use of lcboapi.com,
including any content, functionality and services offered on or via LCBO API
(the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;). The Terms of Service also include the Privacy Policy, that you
can review <a href="/privacy">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using LCBO API,
because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by
these Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave
the Website (although we&rsquo;ll be sad to see you go!), or send a message to
help@lcboapi.com.</p>

<h1>2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website</h1>

<p>LCBO API is a work in progress, meaning that things change over time. LCBO API
reserves the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time
to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in
a prominent way, but since &ldquo;major&rdquo; is a very subjective concept, you can always
monitor this document as it is public on LCBO API.</p>

<h1>3. Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy</h1>

<p>We work hard to ensure LCBO API is as reliable as possible, but can&rsquo;t guarantee
that the Website will be up and running 100% of the time. We also reserve the
right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we
will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is
unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also
section 7 below).</p>

<p>To access certain features of the Website you have to register by entering your
email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must
treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party.
There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but
please notify LCBO API of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose
a strong password (e.g. &ldquo;x39fhsj13fmna301&rdquo;) and that you log out from your
account at the end of every session. API keys and Authentication (Auth) tokens
are also to be treated as passwords and you agree to treat them with the same
level of confidentiality.</p>

<p>It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you
provide on the Website is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may
be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. As
custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user account,
at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our
opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.</p>

<p>We use SSL encrypted browsing for all logged-in users, but we cannot guarantee
that all use will be secure. We also do not guarantee that the Website or any
content provided on the Website is error free. We manage your personal data
according to our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h1>4. Intellectual Property Rights and Use Guidelines.</h1>

<p>The Website and its original content, features and functionality
(including look!), are owned by Carsten Nielsen and are protected by Canadian
and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other
intellectual property or proprietary rights laws. You understand that the data
sources for LCBO API are LCBO.com and Vintages.com, these are publicly
accessible websites and LCBO API is not affiliated or supported by the LCBO
(Liquor Control Board of Ontario). You agree to not copy, modify, create
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, any of our
copyrighted material, except to the extent permitted by the Website itself. If
you have doubts about whether and how to use of material on the Website, please
address your concerns to: support@lcboapi.com.</p>

<p>This means that LCBO API&rsquo;s design, features and original copy (e.g. our Homepage
or documentation) are covered by copyright. The public content, i.e. the
documents hosted here, is subject to the very broad license below and the rules
in Paragraph 5. We wish we could say &ldquo;everything else is public domain&rdquo;, but
it&rsquo;s not that simple!</p>

<p>For purposes of these Terms of Service, the term “Content” includes, without
limitation, information, data, text, photographs, videos, audio clips, written
posts and comments, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features
generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Website.
For the purposes of these Terms of Service, “Content” also includes all User

Website by users (collectively “User Content”), whether publicly posted or
privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated
such User Content. You represent that all User Content provided by you is
accurate, complete, up-to-date, and in compliance with all applicable laws,
rules and regulations. You acknowledge that all Content, including User Content,
accessed by you using the Website is at your own risk and you will be solely

therefrom. We do not guarantee that any Content you access on or through the

<p>By submitting public User Content through the Website, you hereby do and shall
grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid,
sublicensable and transferable license to use, edit, modify, reproduce,

successors’ and assigns’) businesses, including without limitation for

thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels (including,
without limitation, third party websites and feeds). You also hereby do and
shall grant each user of the Website a non-exclusive, perpetual license to
access your User Content through the Website, and to use, edit, modify,
reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such

does not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Content,
including the right to grant additional licenses to your User Content, unless
otherwise agreed in writing. You represent and warrant that you have all rights
to grant such licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third
party rights, including without limitation, any privacy rights, publicity
rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual
property or proprietary rights.</p>

<p>We do not guarantee that any Content will be made available on the Website. We
reserve the right to, but do not have any obligation to, (i) remove, edit or
modify any Content in our sole discretion, at any time, without notice to you
and for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or
allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we
are concerned that you may have violated these Terms of Service), or for no
reason at all and (ii) to remove or block any Content from the Website.</p>

<p>You are permitted to use the Website for your personal, non-commercial use, or
legitimate business purposes, provided that your activities are lawful and in
accordance with these Terms of Service. Prohibited uses include violation of
laws and regulations, hacking the Website in any manner. No right, title or
interest in or to the Website or any content on the site is transferred to you,
and all rights not expressly granted are reserved. Any use of the Website not
expressly permitted by these Terms of Service is a breach of these Terms of
Service and can lead to account termination.</p>

<p>We ecourage your feedback, in the form of reviews, comments, and suggestions or
recommendations for modifications, improvements or changes to the Services or
the Site that you may choose in your sole discretion to provide us from time to
time (“Feedback”). When you provide Feedback, you grant us, under all right,
title and interest in and to the Feedback, a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use
that Feedback or to incorporate it into the Website or other producs or
services.</p>

<p>The Website may contain Content specifically provided by us, our partners or
our users and such Content is protected by copyrights, trademarks, service
marks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights and laws. You shall
abide by and maintain all copyright notices, information, and restrictions
contained in any Content accessed through the Website.</p>

<p>Are you still reading? Awesome! Please bear with us a little longer as what
follows might look as legal boilerplate but it&rsquo;s actually important.</p>

<h1>5. User Contributions and Content Standards. Special Disclaimer for legal content.</h1>

<p>LCBO API contains user generated content, and also may contain message boards,
personal web pages, forums or other interactive features that allow you to
upload, post, submit, publish, display or transmit to other Users Content on or

virus or other malware. More specifically, but without limiting the foregoing,
it must comply with the following Content Standards:</p>

<ul>

<li>As stated above, all the user generated legal documents are in the public domain, unless otherwise specified by the author. The rest of the content (e.g. private documents, comments, description, guides, etc) is creative work, therefore covered by copyright. We claim no intellectual property rights over the User Content.

</ul>

<ol>
<li>Law and Copyright Infringment</li>
</ol>

<p>We do not undertake to review all material before it is posted on the Website,
and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been
posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction
regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by any user or
third party. In the unlikely event we receive a disclosure request from an
authorized party, we reserve the right to disclose user identities when
required to do so by the law, including in response to a law enforcement
request supported by a valid court order. You waive and hold harmless the
Company from any claims resulting from any action taken by the Company during
or as a result of its investigations and from any actions taken as a
consequence of investigations by either the Company or law enforcement
authorities.</p>

<h1>7. Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitations of Liability and Indemnification.</h1>

<p>Your use of LCBO API is at your sole risk. The service is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and
&ldquo;as available&rdquo;. We disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied,
including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose and non-infringement. We are not liable for damages, direct
or consequential, resulting from your use of the Website, and you agree to
defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, losses, liability costs
and expenses (including but not limites to attorney&rsquo;s fees) arising from your
violation of any third-party&rsquo;s rights. You acknowledge that you have only a

of Canada or the courts of the Province of Ontario.</p>

<p>Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of
