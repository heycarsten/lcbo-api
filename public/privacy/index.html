        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      </header>

    <article class="document">
      <p>LCBO API collects and manages user data according to the following Privacy
Policy, with the goal of incorporating the values of transparency,
accessibility, sanity, and usability. This document is part of LCBO API&rsquo;s
<a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>, and by using lcboapi.com (the “Website”), you agree to the
terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service. Please read the Terms
of Service in their entirety, and refer to those for definitions and contacts.</p>

<p>At LCBO API, we use the &ldquo;Privacy by Design&rdquo; approach. This means that we think
of privacy implication before building a new feature, we don&rsquo;t ask for
information we don&rsquo;t need, and we protect the information we have. We take
pride in treating our users&rsquo; privacy the way we&rsquo;d like to be treated by a
website like LCBO API, as individuals.</p>

<h1>Data Collected</h1>

<p>We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic
and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data
sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser
type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.</p>

<p>We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your
name and email address) in order to be able to manage your API keys and view
information associated with them. In order to enable these or any other login
based features, we use cookies and/or local storage to store a session token in
order to retrieve this information for your convenience. You can block or
delete cookies / local storage and still be able to use LCBO API, although if
you do you will then be asked for your username and password every time you
access the logged in featurs of the Website. In order to take advantage of
certain features of the Website, you may also choose to provide us with other
personal information, such as your picture or personal website, but your
decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be
voluntary.</p>

<p>You are able to view, change and remove your data associated with your profile,
you can also permanently delete it and any data associated with it from your
account settings page.</p>

<p>Minors and children should not use LCBO API. By using the Website, you represent
that you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement.</p>

<h1>Use of the Data</h1>

<p>We only use your personal information to provide you the LCBO API services or
to communicate with you about the services or the Website.</p>

<p>With respect to any data you may choose to upload to LCBO API, we take the
privacy and confidentiality of such data seriously. We use an SSL connection to
ensure all data over-the-wire is encrypted between you and us.</p>

<p>We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access
of data about you that we store, including personal information.</p>

<p>We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your
consent, unless:</p>

<ul>
<li>doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request;</li>
<li>we believe it&rsquo;s needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;</li>
<li>we believe it&rsquo;s needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;</li>
<li>otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.</li>
<li>LCBO API is operated from Canada. If you are visiting the Website from outside
of Canada, you agree to any processing of any personal information you provide
us according to this policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>LCBO API may contact you, by email or other means. For example, LCBO API may
send you informational emails relating to LCBO API, or communicate with you
about your use of the LCBO API website. LCBO API may also use technology to
alert us via a confirmation email when you open an email from us. You can
modify your email notification preferences by clicking the appropriate link
included in the footer of email notifications. If you do not want to receive
email from LCBO API, please opt out of receiving emails at the bottom of any
LCBO API emails or by editing your profile preferences.</p>

<h1>Sharing of Data</h1>

<p>We don&rsquo;t share your personal information with third parties. Only aggregated,
anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us
improve the LCBO API Website and service. We currently use Google Analytics
(traffic analysis, SEO optimization), Mandril (email service provider). We
listed below what data these third parties extract exactly. Feel free to check
out their own Privacy Policies to find out more.</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Analytics: anonymous (ad serving domains, browser type, demographics,
language settings, page views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP address)</li>
<li>Mandril: content of emails that we send including email addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>We also use social buttons provided by services like Twitter, Google+, and
Facebook. Your use of these third party services is entirely optional. We are
not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third party
services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those third
party services’ privacy policies.</p>

<p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain
tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need
to share personal information with our Agents in order to provide products or
services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any
right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them
beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of
Personal Information with our Agents.</p>

<p>If we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of
business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that
is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers
may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your
personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h1>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we
collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
information is used. If we make major changes in the way we collect or use
information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Website or
sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy
when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.</p>
